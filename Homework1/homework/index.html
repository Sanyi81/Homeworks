        The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album, published in 1991, is sometimes contradicted by the Simpsons recent
        episodes. In "The Color Yellow", Grandpa Simpson tells Lisa the story of Virgil and Mabel Simpson, which
        directly contradicts the existence of the album's relatives. If it's possible that Grandpa's altered mind
        invented this story, it's also possible that a new canon Simpson family tree has been established, ignoring the
        Album which is almost thirty years old. Also Abraham appeared as an only child, and numerous brothers appeared
        or are mentioned on recently episodes. Homer's mother name appeared as Penelope Olsen which was one of her alias
        and not Mona Simpson. A lot of anonymous Homers relative appeared on Lisa The Simpson.

        Homer Jay Simpson (born May 12, 1956)[36] is the main protagonist of The Simpsons series (or show). He is the
        spouse of Marge Simpson and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. Homer is overweight (said to be ~240
        pounds), lazy, and often ignorant to the world around him. Although Homer has many flaws, he has shown to have
        great caring, love, and even bravery to those he cares about and, sometimes, even others he doesn't. He also
        serves as the main protagonist of the The Simpsons Movie.

        "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such
        as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series

    <p class="lisa">
        Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the
        two tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.

        In "Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words" she is also known as Lisa Bouvier. She was named after a train called
        Lil' Lisa on her parents' 1st anniversary. She is a charismatic 8-year-old girl, who exceeds the standard
        achievement of the intelligence level of children her age. Not to everyone's surprise, she is also the moral
        center of her family. In her upbringing, Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which leads to
        hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced studies. In
        school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her with only
        a few friends. She focuses on her goals and strives to reach her potential, and at the age of eight, she is
        already a member of Mensa with an IQ of 159. Her lack of parental involvement also leads to her lashing out to
        those who she deems lower than her or even above her. She has extreme jealously from time to time and will do
        whatever it takes to reclaim her title as the smartest; but only if she deems it necessary. Otherwise, she's the
        intelligent one who usually thinks things through.
